// Task 1: Write a program that creates a tree in memory for arithmetic expressions. Use
// additional material: parser example in translate.cpp (only for demonstration); an example of
// the Tree class and the main function (tree.cpp); and the input/output example. You may use
// the tree.cpp code provided or use your own code as long as it behaves as expected and matches
// the example.
